Today is the first day of the week: Monday. Some people regard Sunday as the first day of the week,
but my understanding is that the lord *rested* on Sunday, *after* having created various things.
Therefore, as a tribute to the lord, i will create various things for the next six days, and
formally rest on the seventh day.
